# Django-Project

I've developed a Course Management System using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. The system features a user-friendly interface with functionalities including registration and login pages for users, alongside a dynamic courses page allowing for easy creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD) operations. Moreover, administrators can effortlessly manage the system through an intuitive admin panel. This project not only showcases my proficiency in Django development but also demonstrates my ability to design and implement efficient database-driven web applications.
